# Settings
Settings refer to any `handsfree` property that you can define when [instantiating](/guide/getting-started.html#instantiating) with `new HandsfreeModule(SETTINGS)` or using the `handsfree.update(SETTINGS)` method.

Settings can be accessed via `handsfree.settings[KEY]`. The following are all of the settings available:

## `{autostart: BOOLEAN}`
**Default:** `false`

This only really affects instantiation, and is the equivalent to running the following:

```js
handsfree = new HandsfreeModule()
handsfree.start()
```

Running `handsfree.update({autostart: true})` after instantiating `HandsfreeModule` has no affect.

## `{target: DOM_ELEMENT}`
**Default:** `document.getElementById('handsfree-debug')`

This setting lets you set where to inject the debug video and canvas. If omitted during instantiation, `handsfree` will first search the DOM for an element with ID `handsfree-debug`. If one isn't found, and no element is provided, then the debugger will be injected at the end of the document.

`target`'s are given a class of `.handsfree-debug-wrap`, allowing you to add custom styles.

You can also update the location of the debugger, which is useful in Single Page Applications after a route change where the previous target was removed.

The following example demonstrates updating the `target` after instantiation to move it above this codeblock, and then puts it back in the sidebar after 3 seconds.

<div id="demo-target-change-wrap"></div>

```js
handsfree.update({target: document.getElementById('demo-target-change-wrap')})

setTimeout(() => {
  handsfree.update({target: document.body.querySelector('.sidebar > div')})
}, 3000)
```

## `{facingMode: STRING|OBJECT}`
**Default:** `"user"`

Sets the [MediaTrackConstraints facingMode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints/facingMode), which represents the side or the direction (on adjustable cameras) to face.

The following `STRINGS` are accepted:

```bash
"user"        # The front camera on mobile devices or the webcam on laptops
"environment" # The camera facing away from the user or a phone's back camera
"left"        # The camera facing to the left of the user
"right"        # The camera facing to the left of the user
```

Additionally, you can pass a constraining object, such as:

```js
{exact: "user"}
```

```js
handsfree.stop()
handsfree.update({facingMode: {exact: 'environment'}})
handsfree.start()
```

::: danger ðŸ™Š Possible crash warning
The above demo will crash if you don't have an environment facing camera since we're explicitely saying that we want it. Run the following if it does break to correct it.
:::

```js
handsfree.stop()
handsfree.update({facingMode: 'user'})
handsfree.start()
```
